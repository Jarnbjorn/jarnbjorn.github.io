				<p>Most orders are drop-shipped from 3rd party locations. Once an order is processed, it cannot be cancelled. It will need to be accepted and returned in accordance with our return policy. Orders returned to the shipper, for any reason, will be cancelled and refunds will be issued. All charges incurred by a refused or failed delivery will be held from the refund.</p>
				<h3>Return Policy</h3>
				<p>
					If for any reason you're not completely satisfied with your purchase, you may return it within 30 days of the original purchase date for an exchange, or a refund provided it is returnable to inventory as new/unworn. Restocking fees may apply. Please email <a href="mailto:returns@boots99.com" class="returns">returns@boots99.com</a> to request a return authorization (RA#). We may have your item drop-shipped by a 3rd party, and to avoid processing delays and additional shipping cost and/or fees, please obtain a RA # and the correct return shipping address. 
				</p>  
				<p>
					Merchandise must be unworn and be returned with all the original tags and packaging. You are responsible for the shipping cost of returning the item, but if requesting an exchange, we ship the first exchange at no additional cost if shipping to a street address within the contiguous USA. Additional shipping fees apply to all other locations. If returning for a refund, there is a $15 per pair restocking fee on footwear and a 15% restocking fee on all other items. Shipping fees are non-refundable.

				<h3>Unworn Merchandise</h3>				
				<p>
					Includes any item that is in new/unworn condition, still contains the original tags, and is in the original packaging. Returns will be returned to you, at your expense, and no refund or exchange can be issued, if the returned item(s) exhibit signs of wear. For footwear, special care must be taken to prevent showing signs of wear on the soles such as dirt, scuffs or marring.  All original packaging and materials, including boxes, must be returned with your merchandise.
				</p> 
				<h3>Defective Merchandise</h3>				
				<p>
					If you receive a defect item, contact us and we will provide additional information/instructions for returning the defective item. 
				</p>
				<h3>Incorrect Merchandise</h3>
				<p>
					If you received an item shipped in a different size and/or style than you ordered, contact us and we will provide additional information/instructions for returning the incorrect merchandise. 
				</p>
				<h3>Warranty Returns</h3>
				<p>
					Most manufacturers warrant their items from flaws in materials and workmanship for a specific length of time. They do not warrant against end-use damage, or improper use and/or care. We offer no warranty beyond that of the manufacturer, but will assist you with your qualifying warranty return. Contact us for additional information on warranty returns. 
				</p>

				<h2>NOTICE</h2>
				<p>Sizing may vary between manufacturers and styles within the same brand due to cut and/or materials, and in footwear, due to type of leather, toe and/or heel shapes. Minor size variations and/or color variations within a line are not considered flaws in materials or workmanship. The manufacturer/distributor of the merchandise will determine if the item is covered by their warranty.</p>
