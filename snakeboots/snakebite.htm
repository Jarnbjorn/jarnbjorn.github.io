      <font face="Arial" size="4">I received my order of snakeguardz protective 
      leggings yesterday, however, your words of caution are a little late for 
      me.&nbsp; I was bitten by a rattle snake on June 6th.&nbsp; My husband and I farm in 
      Hansford County.&nbsp; We are located at the very top of the Texas panhandle.&nbsp; 
      We just got back from a basketball tournament in Elk City, Ok and decided 
      to check our wheat fields because we were ready to start harvest.&nbsp;&nbsp; My 
      husband was in shorts and I was in capris and flip flops.&nbsp; We were both 
      being careful and looking for snakes before we walked into the fields.&nbsp; I 
      found out the hard way that they can be very hard to see.&nbsp; As I took a 
      step over some dead grass and weeds, I heard the rattle and looked down to 
      see the snake already striking my leg.&nbsp; He bit 2 times.&nbsp; It all happened 
      within seconds.&nbsp; We drove to our local hospital in Spearman, Texas.&nbsp; We 
      were 14 miles out of town and my husband got me there in 8 1/2 minutes.&nbsp; I 
      believe the speed in which we reached the hospital and the great care I 
      received from the nurses and doctors have saved my life and my leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp;</div>
    <div>
      <font face="Arial" size="4">The day I received the snakeguardz was also my 
      first day back to work on the farm.&nbsp; I still have a small amount of 
      swelling in my leg so being able to adjust the leggings is a big plus for 
      me.&nbsp; I was able to walk through grass and around implements with peace of 
      mind that I was protected.&nbsp; I am not sure I would have been able to do my 
      job otherwise.&nbsp; Even with the leggings on I must admit it was still a 
      little scary.&nbsp; I definitely do not want to have to go through that 
      experience again.&nbsp; Needless to say, my whole family and I are much more 
      aware about snakes than we were before.&nbsp; </font>
    </div>
    <div>
      &nbsp;</div>
    <div>
      <font face="Arial" size="4">I did not know that snake protection was 
      available until I found your website.&nbsp; The $70.00 I spent on the order&nbsp; is 
      much cheaper than 18 viles of anti-venom @ $3000.00 per vile and the 
      hospital bill!</font></div>
    <div>
      &nbsp;</div>
    <div>
      <font face="Arial" size="4">I sent attachments of the pictures my son took 
      from his cell phone while I was in the hospital.&nbsp; I went to the ER on 
      Sunday evening and was released on Thursday morning.&nbsp; 159 was Sunday.&nbsp; 135 
      Monday. 143 Tuesday. 151 Wednesday.</font></div>

    <font face="Arial" size="4">I am so sorry that you got bit.&nbsp; It looks like a terrible 
    and painful experience to go through.&nbsp; I hope you are feeling better now.</font></div>
  <div>
    <font face="Arial" size="4">Would it be all right to use your experience and pictures 
    on Snakeboots.com to show people how dangerous rattlesnakes can be?</font></div>

  <p><font face="Arial" size="4">Yes, that would 
  be fine.&nbsp; We were naive about the whole thing.&nbsp; My husband and I both thought 
  that as long as I got to the hospital ASAP that I would be fine and even go 
  home that night.&nbsp; We were so wrong!&nbsp; It was the most painful experience I have 
  ever been through in my life.&nbsp; Again, I was so lucky to have a great hospital 
  and staff close to home.&nbsp; Dr. Mark Garnett with Hansford County Hospital said 
  they treat about one bite per year.&nbsp; He also said mine was the worst one he 
  had seen.&nbsp; He guessed that I got maximum venom in both bites.&nbsp; He was very 
  aggressive with my treatment, but it still took 2 days before he would look me 
  in the eye and tell me I would be fine and I would be able to play golf 
  again!&nbsp; He also told me that people do die from bites this bad.&nbsp; I have lived 
  in Texas all my life and I cannot believe that I knew so little about this.</font></div>
