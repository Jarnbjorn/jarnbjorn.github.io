  Last week I was in Atlanta , Georgia attending a conference. While I was in 
  the airport, returning home, I heard several people behind me beginning to 
  clap and cheer. I immediately turned around and witnessed one of the greatest 
  acts of patriotism I have ever seen. <br>
  <br>
  Moving thru the terminal was a group of soldiers in their camo's, as they 
  began heading to their gate everyone (well almost everyone) was abruptly to 
  their feet with their hands waving and cheering. When I saw the soldiers, 
  probably 30-40 of them, being applauded and cheered for it hit me. I'm not 
  alone. I'm not the only red blooded American who still loves this country and 
  supports our troops and their families. <br>
  <br>
  Of course I immediately stopped and began clapping for these young unsung 
  heroes who are putting their lives on the line everyday for us so we can go to 
  school, work and home without fear or reprisal. Just when I thought I could 
  not be more proud of my country or of our service men and women a young girl, 
  not more than 6 or 7 years old, ran up to one of the male soldiers. He kneeled 
  down and said &quot;hi,&quot; the little girl then she asked him if he would give 
  something to her daddy for her. The young soldier, he didn't look any older 
  than maybe 22, said he would try and what did she want to give to her daddy. 
  Then suddenly the little girl grabbed the neck of this soldier, gave him the 
  biggest hug she could muster and then kissed him on the cheek. <br>
  <br>
  The mother of the little girl, who said her daughters name was Courtney, told 
  the young soldier that her husband was a Marine and had been in Iraq for 11 
  months now. As the mom was explaining how much her daughter, Courtney, missed 
  her father, the young soldier began to tear up. <br>
  <br>
  When this temporarily single mom was done explaining her situation, all of the 
  soldiers huddled together for a brief second. Then one of the other servicemen 
  pulled out a military looking walkie-talkie. They started playing with the 
  device and talking back and forth on it. <br>
  <br>
  After about 10-15 seconds of this, the young soldier walked back over to 
  Courtney, bent down and said this to her, &quot;I spoke to your daddy and he told 
  me to give this to you.&quot; He then hugged this little girl that he had just met 
  and gave her a kiss on the cheek. He finished by saying &quot;your daddy told me to 
  tell you that he loves you more than anything and he is coming home very 
  soon.&quot; <br>
  <br>
  The mom at this point was crying almost uncontrollably and as the young 
  soldier stood to his feet he saluted Courtney and her mom. I was standing no 
  more than 6 feet away from this entire event unfolded. &nbsp;As the soldiers began 
  to leave, heading towards their gate, people resumed their applause. </font>

  As I stood there applauding and looked around, there were very few dry eyes, 
  including my own. That young soldier in one last act of selflessness, turned 
  around and blew a kiss to Courtney with a tear rolling down his cheek. <br>
  <br>
  We need to remember everyday all of our soldiers and their families and thank 
  God for them and their sacrifices. At the end of the day, it's good to be an 
  American. <br>

  every Friday. The reason? Americans who support our troops used to be called 
  the &quot;silent majority&quot;. We are no longer silent, and are voicing our love for 
  God, country and home in record breaking numbers. &nbsp;We are not organized, 
  boisterous or over-bearing. We get no liberal media coverage on TV, to reflect 
  our message or our opinions. <br>
  <br>
  Many Americans, like you, me and all our friends, simply want to recognize 
  that the vast majority of America supports our troops. Our idea of showing 
  solidarity and support for our troops with dignity and respect starts this 
  Friday -and continues each and every Friday until the troops all come home,
