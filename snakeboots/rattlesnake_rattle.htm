What makes a rattlesnake's rattle...rattle?

<pre><font size="4">Dear Daniel: 
The sound of a rattler's raspy buzz fills most hikers with dread -- and for good reason. </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">Rattlesnakes, who belong to the pit viper family, are known for beating the pointy tips </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">of their tails against the ground to ward off enemies. </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">A rattlesnake baby is born with what's called a &quot;pre-button&quot; at the end of its tail. </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">When the rattlesnake sheds its skin (which happens about 10 days after birth and every </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">few months thereafter), the skin gets caught on the pre-button and a button is formed. </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">At the second shed, the first segment is formed and can now rattle slightly against </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">the button. Each time the snake sheds, a new segment is added and the rattle gets longer </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">and louder. The segments knocking against each other create the sound and allow a </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">rattlesnake to rattle its tail in the air rather than beat it against the ground. </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">The rattle can be loud: its frequency can peak at 5,000 to 8,000 hertz </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">(which is roughly equivalent to an ambulance siren) and at a loudness of 60-80 </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">decibels from a distance of one meter. </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">However, as a rattlesnake gets older, the outer segments of the rattle sometimes </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">become brittle and fall off. That's why you can never tell the age of a snake by </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">the size of its rattle. Not that you were eager to examine them up close anyway.</font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">When you go outdoors always wear your Chippewa Snake Boots to protect yourself </font></pre>
<pre><font size="4">from rattlesnake bite on your calf and ankle.</font></pre>
