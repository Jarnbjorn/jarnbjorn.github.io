				<p>This site is owned and operated by Outdoor Country.  We are a family owned business with our retail location in Bishop, TX. We are  dedicated to supplying  our customers the finest name brand merchandise. We have been in business over 20 years and  moved into cyberspace in 1999, with our first website www.Boots99.com . At our retail location we carry boots and shoes from Justin, Chippewa, Red Wing, Rocky, Durango, Georgia, LaCrosse, Double H, Bates, Danner and more and can now offer these fine brands nationwide.</p>
				<p>Our websites are our online catalogs which enable us to offer a much larger selection of boots than we carry in our store and since we have them drop-shipped directly from the manufacturers, we can offer lower prices because we don't have to hold them in our inventory.</p>
				<p>Although we make every effort to keep our sites current, there are times a boot manufacturer is temporarily out of a style or size of boot.  If the boot you ordered is not immediately available for shipment, we will contact you to see if you would like a different brand/style.  If you don't, we will simply cancel the order.</p>

				<h3>Shipping Policy</h3>

				<p>
					We currently ship domestically only.  Our shipping prices listed on the order page are for UPS, SurePost, FedEx, SmartPost and USPS shipping within the continental USA. Shipments to Alaska and Hawaii are handled differently.  The boots are shipped to our store and then we ship them to Alaska and Hawaii by USPS so there is a timeline and shipping price difference.  Please contact us at customerservice@boots99.com for a shipping quote and estimate of delivery time before placing your order if outside our normal shipping area. 
				</p>  
				<p>
					Your order is placed the same day it is received by us, but depending on time of day and day of week, the boot companies may not process the order immediately.  Most orders received before 1:00pm CT Monday through Thursday are shipped the same day.  Orders received after 1:00pm CT are normally processed the next business days. Orders received after 1:00pm CT Friday or on weekends are processed on Monday.  In case of holidays, orders are processed on the first working day after the holiday.  This usually leads to a delivery time of 7-10 working days on regular ground depending on time and day of week order is received.  
				</p> 			
				<p>
					We accept payment by credit card, money order or personal check.  Credit cards are not processed until the boot is confirmed ready to ship.  If payment is made by check, the boot is shipped after the check clears.  If payment is made by money order, the boot is shipped upon receipt of the payment.
				</p>   
				
				<h3>Return Policy</h3>				
				<p>
					We are allowed to return an order once for an exchange of size/style without penalty from the boot manufacturer, but this does require you pay shipping back for exchange.  We pay to have the replacement shipped to you.  There is a $15 restocking fee and additional shipping fees for any further exchanges.  If a boot is returned for any reason other than warranty problems or first exchange of size, there is a $15 restocking fee. Shipping fees are non-refundable unless we made the mistake or it's a warranty return.
				</p> 				
				<p>
					If a return is necessary, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:returns@boots99.com" class="returns">returns@boots99.com</a> so we can furnish  a RETURN AUTHORIZATION number to place on the package and the  address to which the boot is to be returned.  Be sure and include your name, boot brand and style and the email address you used on your original order so we can locate you in our system.  If the boot is returned without a return authorization number, it could be refused by the manufacturer and returned to you postage due.  So please, email for a RA number.  Normally, this is a very smooth process, the only snags we have had  were because packages arrived at the manufacturer's  facility without a return authorization number. Credit is not issued until the boot shows up as "returned to inventory". This could take up to two months after receipt of the boot. If you have any questions or concerns, just email us and weâ€™ll help in any way we can.
