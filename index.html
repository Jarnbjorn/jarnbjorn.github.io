        <p>I'm fairly new to web design and development, but I'm not new to information technology at all. I view every job and project as a great opportunity to learn something new and further develop my skills. Above all, I want to create things. I view creation as the highest form of human accomplishment, and creativity is a cornerstone of my life. </p>

              <li>I have an Associates Degree in Information Technology &amp; Network Support</li>
